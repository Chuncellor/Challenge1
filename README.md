Module 1 Challenge

Description

For this challenge, we were tasked with altering a websites code to make it more accessible and to cleanup several aspects of the code. To do this I first observed what was wrong with the accessibility of the website as a whole. The first thing I noticed was that one of the tabs did not link to where it was supposed to on the page, so I needed to fix that. With the help of lighthouse, I was also able to identify some issues with the images and the general semantics of the existing code. I proceeded to use what I have learned in class to fix the accessibility issue and reorder the semantics so it made the site more accessible. The next challenge was to clean up the css sheet, which I did by grouping several of the sections together into lists of sort. The final step was to add comments to inform others of how the code is functioning and several labels which may prove useful to remember for furture projects and challenges. To finish up, I adjusted some of the font-sizes as to make the page more user-friendly.
